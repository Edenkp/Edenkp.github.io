# Smart Questions, Better Answers

When asking questions, you may notice how asking a simple question gets a simple answer while asking a more complicated, detailed question gets you an answer that is detailed, and maybe complicated. The same applies for "smart questions". A "smart question" is a question that shows that a person is willing to learn from others and is considerate of a responder's time. 

## Asking Smart Questions

After reading Eric Raymond's [How to ask questions the smart way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#intro), some important things to consider before asking your question are:
- Find an answer by searching in archives of forums or mailing lists you plan on posting to.
- Search the web for your answer.
- Read the manual for an answer.
- Read an FAQ for an answer.
- Find an answer by experimentation or inspection.
- Ask a skilled friend for an answer.
- Find an answer by reading source code (if you are a programmer).
Doing these things and letting others know that you have done these things will tell potential responders that you have done your part by spending time trying to figure it out on your own. This shows other people that not only have you learned some things throughout the time you spent trying to find your answer, but also that you're not being lazy. Some questions can be solved simply by looking on the internet, so to avoid wasting people's time when you can solve you question by doing exactly that, you'll more than likely get people to answer your question.
