Music has played a huge role in my life. From starting off learning piano at the age of 7 years old, to now being a member
of the biggest music organizations at the university. 

The University of Hawaii Rainbow Warrior Marching Band is well known across campus, as well as across the island. The band can be seen at sporting events, such as
football games, basketball games, and volleyball games. This group consists of over 250+ members that come from different states and different countries. It also 
consists of students ranging from many different majors, whether they are music majors or not.

Below is a playlist of shows/performances that I have been a part of:
