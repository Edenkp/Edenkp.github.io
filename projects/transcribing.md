After immersing myself into the world of music for the past 8+ years, I have come to appreciate the genre of classical music, as well as music played by
wind ensembles. Sometimes, I may find a lick, or a passage, from a piece that I'm listening to and try to transcribe or translate it so I can read and play it myself. 

Not only have I transcribed passages from pieces, but I have also transcribed music for smaller chamber groups/ensembles, such as saxophone quartets. Because I am able to recognize 
pitches perfectly, I am capable of writing out music if I don't have access to actual sheet music. I am also capable of reading music in different keys, so if I ever come 
across pieces that I like but they are in a different key, then I can transcribe it in the key that I want it to be read in.

Recently, I transcribed and created a warm up for a high school marching band so they could use it. Originally, I took a warm up that I remember my high school band do, 
so I did my best to recreate that exact warm up based on memory and perfect pitch.
