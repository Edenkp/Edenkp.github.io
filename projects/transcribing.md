After immersing myself into the world of music for the past 8+ years, I have come to appreciate the genre of classical music, as well as music played by
wind ensembles. Sometimes, I may find a lick, or a passage, from a piece that I'm listening to and try to transcribe or translate it so I can read and play it myself. 

Not only have I transcribed passages from pieces, but I have also transcribed music for smaller chamber groups/ensembles, such as saxophone quartets. Because I am able to recognize pitches perfectly, I am capable of writing out music if I don't have access to actual sheet music. I am also capable of reading music in different keys, so if I ever come across pieces that I like but they are in a different key, then I can transcribe it in the key that I want it to be read in. Recently, I transcribed and created a warm up for a high school marching band so they could use it. Originally, I took a warm up that I remember my high school band do, 
so I did my best to recreate that exact warm up based on memory and perfect pitch.

As a transcriber in music, my role is to create music or sheet music for others or myself to read and enjoy. This is important especially if sheet music cannot be obtained for certain music. My responsibility is to make sure that the sheet music is properly written out so when it is played out loud, it sounds correct.

From this experience, I learned how to use software to create sheet music that I could potentially use for myself or share to others. It has also helped me to improve on perfect pitch, or the ability to recognize notes from hearing it. Transcribing music has helped me to learn how to translate different keys of music into something that I could understand.
